This directory contains the access points for a lot of experiments within Geodesy_Modeling.
For better or worse, it's somewhat research code mixed with library code,
because I wanted to have a record of the clever things I was doing with this library.
Each driver here is tailored to a specific project.

For now, this directory is on my system path.  For better or worse.
